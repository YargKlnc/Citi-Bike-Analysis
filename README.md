## OVERVIEW ##

New York Citi Bike, recognized as the leading bike-sharing initiative in the United States, is committed to elevating its services by strategically identifying the Top 5 Most Popular and Busiest Stations in Manhattan. This initiative focuses on enhancing the customer experience through the installation of cutting-edge prefabricated service facilities. These facilities are envisioned to feature amenities like complimentary Wi-Fi, restroom facilities, and vending machines stocked with rider essentials. Furthermore, each service hub will include a dedicated customer service counter providing free guidance to tourists, complete with city maps, ensuring comprehensive support for both customers and subscribers. This strategic investment aligns with the program's dedication to delivering unparalleled biking experiences and fostering positive relationships with its riders.

Since its inception in 2013, the Citi Bike program has diligently built a robust infrastructure for the systematic collection of data on program utilization. Monthly, the program meticulously gathers and organizes comprehensive bike data, making it publicly accessible through the Citi Bike DataLinks webpage. Despite regular updates to the dataset, the team has yet to implement a comprehensive dashboard or sophisticated reporting mechanism.

Acknowledging the need for deeper insights, city officials have posed a series of inquiries aimed at understanding the program's performance and impact more comprehensively. Addressing these questions calls for the development of an effective and visually intuitive dashboard, facilitating data-driven decision-making and fostering transparency in program evaluation. This holistic approach, combining enhanced service facilities and advanced data analytics, underscores the program's commitment to continuous improvement and customer satisfaction.

In this comprehensive analysis, the dataset acquired from Citi Bike encompasses the intricate details spanning the months of **June, July, August, and September for the years 2019 and 2020**. This meticulous curation of data serves as the cornerstone for searching and identifying the **Top 5 Most Popular and Busiest stations**. The inclusion of multiple months and years in this dataset enhances the depth of our exploration, providing a robust foundation for a thorough and comparative analysis. This approach enables a nuanced understanding of trends and patterns over a substantial timeframe, contributing valuable insights to the program's strategic initiatives and decision-making processes.
